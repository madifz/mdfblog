<p class="has-text-align-left">
  It’s been a rough week at work and spent the past few days focused at my day job and resting when at home. Without a system to ensure that I do something every day, I racked up a chain of 5 zero days between 26/8 to 31/8.
</p>

I decided to set up a system to structure my days so that I will definitely put in at least a one-liner every day regardless of the situation. On top of that, the system, will also make it more sustainable for me to maintain no zero days by determining the extent of work I should put in every day depending on my fatigue, motivation and schedule.

[1] Tracking: A one line code added to <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://FirstWebsite.danialfaizsal.repl.co" target="_blank">First Website</a> (can be content, tags, add or modifications etc.) and a corresponding one line progress log on blog that also updates ‘_Days since last Zero Day_’ tracker. Should take 2-3 minute tops and will guarantee no zero days.

[2] Implementation Intentions: If/Then conditionals to plan day-to-day schedule that will determine how extensive the progress should be. The conditionals were designed after considering my irregular shift schedule. Basically: If (tomorrow) == >10.45am shift OR Off day; Then log an additional coding/learning session + If (today) == OFF day; Then log an additional coding/learning session. Note that this is in addition to the daily one line code + progress log at the start of each day.

[3] Coping plans: These are plans (also in the form of an If/Then conditional) to prepare for specific circumstances where an additional coding/learning session cannot be logged. Basically: If EOW / Off day == bad day / late OR close to bedtime / busy errand day; Then write one line code + one line progress log. There are 2 reasons for the additional one line code + one line progress log in addition to the one already planned at the start of the day namely: (a) A bad day might start from point of waking up so this coping plan acts as a failsafe & (b) starting and ending the day with the one line code + one line progress log ritual reinforces the No Zero Days habit and increases the odds that the next day will be a No Zero Day; in effect creating a chain effect that should theoretically be hard to break.

Days since last Zero Day: 1 (31/8/20)
