Went into the CSS portion of Andrei Neagoie&#8217;s Zero to Mastery WebDev course; it&#8217;s more a refresher of CSS concepts that I went through in freeCodeCamp.

The introductory CSS lesson outlined the basics to writing CSS and Andrei went some way to explain why css code is contained in a separate file rather than having the code inline within the html file; namely separation of concerns

As websites get bigger and more complex, it&#8217;s cleaner to separate code governing styles from the main website code so that it&#8217;s easier to edit appearance of the website without adding lines to the main website code.
