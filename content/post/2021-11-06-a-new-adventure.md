The last time I posted I was embarking on an ambitious personal project &#8211; [Project 300][1]. The process was rough; I had temporarily stopped all non-essential activities, namely gaming and tabletop trading card games. My days were a cycle of work and code, rinse and repeat. I completed freeCodeCamp&#8217;s JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures and managed to clear a significant portion of The Odin Project&#8217;s Foundations.

The plan/goal was that by 14 March 2022, I would be in a role (internal or external) that was closer to code and software development. However, midway through around end-August, I decided to apply for a Technical Support Engineer role Adyen that involved reading and debugging code as part of the job scope. I did not really expect that I would get very far, as my knowledge extended to basic HTML/CSS, JavaScript, Python and surface-level SQL. Regardless, I went in with the mindset that no matter what the outcome, I would still at least get feedback on where I am currently in my learning journey. 

I managed to clear all 5 rounds to receive an offer which I accepted! Looking back, I remember that the technical assessment round, which was a take-home assignment that required me implementing the company&#8217;s API integration using Postman and testing the API calls to get the response required of the scenario. It was fun because it was the first time that I was integrating APIs and using Postman, and it was exciting observing my API integration receiving the expected responses.

It&#8217;s now my first week in the role, and to be honest it&#8217;s still pretty surreal. There is an overwhelming amount of knowledge to go through, considering that complexities of the payments industry. Excited to see where this adventure takes me!
