Finally starting with learning JavaScript after taking so long with HTML and CSS. Having learnt Python before, it&#8217;s a gentler slope to overcome when learning JS.

First few lessons are simple basics, i.e. understanding what are numbers, strings, booleans, comparisons, variables. There was also a couple of exercises to practice with in the browser dev console.

Also learnt control flow, namely conditionals. Very similar to Python except slightly different syntax (OR is||, AND is &&, NOT is !).
