My last #100DaysOfCode log was on 14 Feb 2020. Up to that point, I had made 2 attempts and was starting to gain momentum with learning Python and Machine Learning. I was sure that AI/ML would be the path that I wanted to move towards. It’s been about 16 months since, and the world is a different place.

With Covid-19 turning lives upside down, my life similarly underwent significant changes, some intended, some unintended:

  * Mar 2020: lockdown in Singapore in the form of “circuit breaker”.
  * Mar &#8211; Apr 2020: in the midst of work from home (WFH), I completed Python Crash Course and learnt basic Python, but realized that I wanted to do more with code, I wanted to build things that help and add value. Thus begin a pivot to web development.
  * May &#8211; Jun 2020: Volunteered to assist my company via remote tech support role while waiting for lockdown to end. In that time, I also started freeCodeCamp’s Responsive Web Design course.
  * Jul 2020: Return to work and adjusting to a new tech support role in store.
  * Sep 2020: Completed freeCodeCamp’s Responsive Web Design course. Started freeCodeCamp JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures course.
  * Oct 2020 &#8211; Mar 2021: Hit a rough patch with my work, and this time was interspersed with occasional coding, adjusting to new role, gaming in my free time.
  * Mar &#8211; Apr 2021: A relative asked me to consider a startup role that was very different from tech, and while doing so, started a brief self-directed learning experience with marketing and growth hacking. At the same time, also applied for an internal programme to try out and shadow a corporate technical role in my company.
  * May 2021: A new Covid-19 wave resurging in Singapore resulting in a quasi-lockdown state termed “Phase 2 (Heightened Alert)”. Radio silence from the startup marketing role.
  * Early Jun 2021: Interview for the internal company experience for Escalations Engineer role (tech stack &#8211; Python, SQL, Charles Proxy, Splunk). Take home challenge to learn SQL, Charles Proxy, Splunk, and review Python in 4 days. Managed basic surface learning of technologies; bombed the technical interview. Silver lining &#8211; suddenly found new momentum to continue learning.
  * 14 June 2021: Crafted and started a personal 39-week plan to reignite web development journey with 3 distinct phases. Now titled Project 300 (i.e. 3 x #100DaysOfCode).
  * 19 June 2021: And so here we are.

While I already started the project on 14 June, I felt that instead of doing it in private, learning in public would supercharge the process and also act as another driving force to maintain the renewed momentum that I gained, ironically from a failed interview. I am restarting my #100DaysOfCode today, and the plan is to do it 3 times in parallel to my 39-week plan.

The roadmap for Project 300:

  * Commitment &#8211; 12hrs/week  
    Workdays &#8211; 1hrs/day  
    Off Days &#8211; 3.5hrs/day
  * Learn in Public
  * Restart #100DaysOfCode
  * Tweet updates
  * 1 blog post weekly

Phase 1: Fundamentals (14 June to 12 Sep &#8211; 13 weeks)

  * Complete freeCodeCamp JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures
  * Complete The Odin Project Foundations & Full Stack JavaScript
  * Complete Watch and Code (free)
  * [Optional] Complete Full Stack Open

Phase 2: Portfolio Building (13 Sep to 12 Dec &#8211; 13 weeks

  * Portfolio site
  * Blog site
  * Bug tracker
  * Budget tracker

Phase 3: Network and Expand (13 Dec to 13 Mar &#8211; 13 weeks)

  * Get feedback on portfolio
  * Offer to build a website for a friend/relative

Some tools I&#8217;m using to help me with my daily goals:

  * Done App to track daily tasks
  * Day One App to journal daily affirmations
  * Toggl track to track time on coding and learning
