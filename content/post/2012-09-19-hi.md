Everything starts with a Hello World.

So I&#8217;ve decided to set up my own personal landing page for all my exploits, mainly because it&#8217;s easier to describe the smattering of side projects I&#8217;m involved. Plus, it makes for a great networking namecard. The site&#8217;s pretty bare now as I&#8217;m still tying some loose ends but the main pages of the site should be ready soon.

Meanwhile, you can just go crazy clicking on the headers and enjoy the smooth scrolling of the site.
