So exams are done and semester is officially over. While it has been a somewhat turbulent few months for me, which also saw me taking a short trip to Malacca to visit grandma and at the same time do a bit of self-instropection, I must say that I&#8217;ve come out with not only clarity of vision but also a greater sense of purpose. Previously, I was doing too many different things at the same time without really knowing if everything tied in with what I really wanted to do. But not anymore. And yesterday was probably a start towards what is hopefully a very productive holiday.

After a sort of hiatus from NUSMS events, I&#8217;ve decided to join up with one of the project committees and recently had our first meeting. Once details are confirmed, I&#8217;ll be sure to post more of it here, but suffice to say it looks to be a very interesting event.

I also had the opportunity to attend a session of [Suara Musyawarah][1]. For those who might not have heard about it, Suara Musyawarah is an Independent Committee to engage the Malay/Muslim community by gathering feedback, opinion and perspectives from the ground. It can probably be alluded to the [National Conversation][2], but more specifically targeted for the Malay/Muslim community. The session I attended was mainly composed of tertiary students and young professionals, and many pertinent issues and sentiments were raised. It&#8217;ll be interesting to see what kind of opinions and perspectives from the community might arise as more of such sessions are conducted. If more segments of the Malay/Muslim community are represented in such sessions, I&#8217;m sure a very frank and enlightening collection of perspectives from the community can be extracted.

In other news, I might also be involved in another Youth Expedition Project, but we&#8217;ll see God Willing:)
