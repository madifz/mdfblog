Managed to quickly complete the final project for the Responsive Web Design Certification by re-using boilerplate code that I had previously from the ZTM web dev course, to create a barebones personal portfolio website. Now ready to deep dive into JavaScript.<figure class="wp-block-embed-wordpress wp-block-embed is-type-wp-embed is-provider-codepen">
