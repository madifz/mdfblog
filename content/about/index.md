# Hello World

## Established in the 90s

Hi there, Danial here, how are you today?

I read philosophy in university, worked about 5 years in law enforcement before realizing I wanted to make tech my lifelong career. I am currently a technical support engineer at a payments service provider troubleshooting APIs and integrations.

Outside of work, I am learning web development and hope to one day be able to build fast, secure and accessible websites for as many types of devices as possible.

For fun and leisure, I play the Pokemon trading card game, am a mechanical keyboard enthusiast and a diehard West Ham United fan.

I care deeply about social inequality and believe that the world would be a better place with more social equity i.e. equal opportunities + equitable conditions).
